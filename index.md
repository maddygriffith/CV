She oversees the implementation research and program evaluation workstreams in Nigeria and Uganda for the Innovations for Choice and Autonomy (ICAN) implementation research project, and supports qualitative and quantitative data management and analysis as well. She also manages two discrete choice experiment (DCE) research projects: one on self-managed abortion preferences in Mississippi, and another on PrEP preferences among young men in South Africa. She has extensive experience with clinical research coordination and project management, and is interested in promoting reproductive health and education for all, particularly underserved populations.
